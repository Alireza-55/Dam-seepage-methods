In this Project I've used boundry conditions of 57 and 90 
Also the Limits for X and Y were 54 and 17
The number of times it repeats itself is 1000 to get 1.0e-3 tolerance
3 methods used with each time deleting the previous results from the memory, putting new ones with the next method
The project prints itself in Notepad files
